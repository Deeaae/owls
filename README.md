Service responsible for sending sms out
This is a part of project where I intend to build set of microservices which I beleive to be a basic building blocks for most of the projetcs.
These set of services are created with an intention to help me get started with some of the major projects wihtout thinking too much about the not so important stuff.
To list the such not so important stuff here is the small list
1. Basic Messaging Service
2. Login Service
3. User data management
4. Configuration Service
5. Logging Service
6. 

I would like to point out that not so important stuff I mentioned above are indeed very important when you look at them individually, however with bigger picture that might not be all that important to get you started or worth the time that you might spend up on them when the focus is really on something more important.
